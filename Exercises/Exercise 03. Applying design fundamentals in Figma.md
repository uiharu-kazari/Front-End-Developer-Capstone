Exercise: Applying design fundamentals in Figma
Overview
This exercise will cover the steps from wireframes to high-fidelity mock-ups and apply design fundamentals using the brand style guide, which specifies every aspect of the look and feel of the brand. This includes typefaces, colors, and how pictures and images should be used. It also includes a UI kit, a set of files containing critical UI components like font sizes, icons and documentation. A Figma file of the wireframe used in this exercise and an image resource folder is provided below.

On completion, you will have the skills necessary to take the wireframes of your design solution for your project on the reserve-a-table section of the Little Lemon website to produce high-fidelity mock-ups. You may wish to revise the following lesson items in the Principles of UX/UI course before you begin or refer to them as you go along:
