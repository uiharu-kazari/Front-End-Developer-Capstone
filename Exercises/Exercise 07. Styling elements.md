Exercise: Styling elements
Overview
Now that the layout of the Little Lemon web app is set up, the next step is to set up the necessary CSS rules to apply the visual stylings based on the design that you built in Figma. In this exercise, you’ll use your CSS skills to code the way specific HTML elements should look on the Little Lemon web app. 

Scenario
Little Lemon wants you to implement recognizable styles for HTML elements on their restaurant app. In this exercise, you will style these HTML elements. The styles need to be in line with the Figma design and wireframe you created, including, for example, font size, spacing, line height, colors, background colors and borders. 

In preparation for this exercise, you can recap CSS selectors, best practices and examples by referring to the following lesson items in the HTML and CSS in-depth course:

Widely used selectors

All selectors and their specificity

Combination selectors

Pseudo-classes

Instructions
Step 1: Consider your Figma design and wireframe
Inspect the design and mockup for your app. During your evaluation, you may consider:

What is the common theme across your site?

What are the colors?

What are the font sizes?

What are the responsive design considerations?

Will your HTML elements (including images) have the border radius set to 0 or will it be somewhat rounded?

Will your divs, articles, asides and other tags have a CSS shadow?

What other CSS properties you can think of?

Step 2: Style the HTML headings, paragraphs and spans
Bearing in mind design considerations, style your headings, paragraphs and spans, namely, the following elements:

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6

p

span

Step 3: Style the navigation elements
Bearing in mind design considerations, style your navigation elements, namely:

nav

ul

li

Step 4: Style your images
Bearing in mind design considerations, style your images, that is, the img tag.

Note: You might need to come back to this task again and again as you develop the app and fine-tune the styling.

Step 5: Apply the rules to existing HTML elements
Open your previously created component files and apply the CSS rules to the HTML elements.

Step 6: Verify that the HTML elements are styled correctly
Run your app using the npm-start command.

Open the web browser and go to 
http://localhost:3000
 to view the web app.

Ensure that the elements are styled correctly in the web browser.

Using the web browser developer tools, view the web page in responsive mode to ensure that the elements are styled correctly on a mobile device.
