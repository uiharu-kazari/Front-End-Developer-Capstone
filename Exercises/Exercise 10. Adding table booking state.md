Exercise: Adding table booking state
Overview
Previously, you set up the BookingForm component and tracked its state. However, to be truly functional, your Little Lemon reserve-a-table web app functionality will need to be able to share state across components.

Scenario
The goal of this exercise is for you to expand the implementation of the component for the Booking page of the Little Lemon website. 

As part of the reserve-a-table web app functionality, the page will display the existing booked table times and available slots, using a list component containing several instances of a BookingSlot component.  

Available booking slots will be shared between the components and updated when the user submits the form. As your progress through the exercise, it may be worth revising the following lesson items in the Advanced React course:

Working with React hooks

Lifting up state

Working with complex data in useState

What is useReducer and how it differs from useState

Instructions
Step 1: Life state up to the Main component
As you added the table booking state to the BookingForm component in the previous exercise, in this exercise, you need to lift the state up to the Main component. This is the preferred approach in this case, as your app is relatively simple.

Move the availableTimes useState hook from the BookingForm component into the Main component

Pass down the state and state changing functions from the Main component to the BookingForm component using props in order to make state work across different components.

Step 2: Update BookingForm to display available times based on the selected date
The next step is to prepare the available times to be updated based on the date the user has selected. To do this, you will change the availableTimes state to a reducer.

In the Main component, create a function named updateTimes which will handle the state change. This function will change the availableTimes based on the selected date. For now, the function can return the same available times regardless of the date.

Next, create a function called initializeTimes which will create the initial state for the availableTimes.

Then, change availableTimes to a reducer using the useReducer function and provide the two previous functions as parameters.

Update the BookingForm component to dispatch the state change when the date form field is changed.

Tip: Include the newly selected date in the dispatch parameter.

Conclusion
By completing this exercise, you should now have an app for Little Lemon in which state works across several components, moving you another step closer to having a fully-functional booking page. 

Although outside the scope of this capstone project, it’s worth mentioning that you may favor more robust state management approaches in the case of larger or more complex apps.
