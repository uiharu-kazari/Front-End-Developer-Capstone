Exercise: Setting up the CSS layout
Overview
To build upon the wireframes you designed for the Little Lemon reserve-a-table web app functionality, your next task is to create the web app layout using HTML and CSS. In this exercise, you will use your CSS skills to code reusable sections of your app’s layout.  The code you write in this exercise is one of many building blocks that you can use and reuse in different parts of your React app.

Scenario
Visitors to the Little Lemon website will be viewing the content on different devices, from small devices such as mobile phones to large devices like desktops and tablets. Therefore, the owners of Little Lemon have requested that the website is responsive.  To achieve this you will need to implement the responsive column layout that you previously planned, using either a CSS Grid or Flexbox Layout. In this exercise, you will create the necessary CSS rules to allow for a responsive layout. You will apply these rules throughout the course.  As you progress through the exercise, it may be helpful to revisit the following lesson items from the HTML and CSS in-depth course:

CSS web layout

CSS units of measurement

Understanding Flexbox

Basic Flexbox

CSS Grids

Grids and Flexbox cheat sheet

Instructions
Step 1: Set up the CSS rules
Based on the mockup, decide if you will use a CSS Grid or Flexbox Layout

Open the app.

Based on the mockup, add the required CSS Grid or Flexbox rules to the file.

Tip: If you are unsure which rules to add, refer to the 
Grids and Flexbox cheat sheet
 lesson item.

Step 2: Apply the CSS rules to HTML elements
Open the index.html file and apply the CSS rules to the HTML elements.

Open your previously created component files and apply the CSS rules to the HTML elements.

Step 3: Verify that the HTML elements are positioned correctly
Run your app using the npm start command

Open the web browser and go to 
http://localhost:3000
 to view the web app.

Ensure that the elements are positioned correctly in the web browser

Using the web browser developer tools to view the web page in responsive mode, ensure that the elements are positioned correctly on a mobile device.

Conclusion
By completing this exercise, the Little Lemon website’s visual layout will display correctly on different device sizes. This will provide a good user experience to visitors of the website.
